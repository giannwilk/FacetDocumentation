Each section will be explained in more detail further down.\n\n1. Write your documentation, in the file located in /magnificent/documentation/Readme.md\n\n2. Generate your documentation using the tool provided in magnificent/tools/ and update your Readme.js file.\n\n3. Finally, update your config options  in magnificent/documentation/config.js (optionally add your own  background image or video)\n\nAnd just like that, you have magnificent documentation!\n\nNow you can include the documentation folder with your product or service.\n\n\nWriting Your Docs\n===\n\nThe Basics\n---\n\nWriting your documentation is super easy. By leveraging the markdown language (text files ending in .md) we can edit a single text file to create our documentation.\n\nTo get started you can simply open up the Readme.md file located in magnificent/documentation/Readme.md. You can open this file in any text editor or you can use a [free and simple Markdown](http://mouapp.com/) app like \n\n![Alt text](assets/img/docapp.png)\n\nfor Mac or [Markdown pad for PC](http://markdownpad.com/)\n\n![Alt text](assets/img/docapp-pc.png)\n\nThe contents in that file are the contents that we used to build this documentation.\n\nCreating a Section\n---\n\nTo create a top-level section like this, you would use the following syntax in the Readme.md file:\n\n```html\n	Writing Your Docs\n	===\n```\nThat is your headline and the next line is 3 equal marks.\n\nCreating Sections\n---\nTo create a section, you would use the following syntax in the Readme.md file:\n\n```html\n	Creating Sections\n	---\n```\nThat is your section and the next line is 3 dashes.\n\n### Creating a Subsection\n\nTo create a sub-section, you would use the following syntax in the Readme.md file:\n\n```html\n	### Creating a Subsection\n```\nThat is your sub-section previous three characters are \'#\'.\n\n\nCreating code blocks\n---\n\ncreating code blocks like the one above, you would use the following:\n\n```\n ` ` `\n```\n\n three forward accent keys without spaces and three accent keys after the code block.\n\nand that is your code block.\n\ncreating buttons\n---\n\nTo create buttons you can use the following syntax \n\nIf your link text has a `>` at the end (for instance: `[I\'m a button bitch >](http://magnificent.devdojo.com)`), they show\nup as buttons.\n\n[I\'m a button bitch >](http://magnificent.devdojo.com)\n\nfurther reading\n---\n\nWe\'re not going to show you every bit of writing in Markdown language since there are so many great resources out there that can teach you every bit you need to know, or you can always use the default Readme.md and modify it to display your documentation.\n\nClick the link below to learn all the elements of using the Markdown language:\n\n[Learn More about Mark Down >](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)\n\n\nGenerating your docs\n===\n\nWhy do you need to use the tools\n---\n\nUsing the tool provided you can create your documentation and make it ready for your users in a snap.\n\nWe could always load the Readme.md file into HTML and show it that way, but if you wanted to provide this documentation in your product and allow your user to be able to open it even without an internet connection you\'ll have to load your Readme into a local JavaScript file. Which is why we created a simple tool for that.\n\n\nUsing the magnificent tool\n---\n\nTo use the tool you can simply open up /magnficent/tools/index.html. When you open it up you will can enter in your Readme.md text file. Then the output will be displayed in the output textarea. Be sure to copy this for the next step.\n\n\nUpdating your Readme.js file\n---\nNext, you\'ll need to open and paste the text you\'ve just copied into the file located in /magnificent/documentation/Readme.js.\n\nAnd that\'s it. You should be able to open the file located in magnificent/documentation/Readme.html and your new documentation is ready for your users.\n\nYou may want to configure your documentation to fit your products needs and look. Keep reading the next section on configuring your documentation.\n\nConfiguring your docs\n===\n\nTo configure your documentation you will open up the following file\n\n/magnificent/documentation/config.js\n\nAnd you should see the following options:\n\n```\nvar magnificent = {\n\n  headline : "Magnificent Documentation",\n  name : "Magnificent 1.0",\n  short_description : "A beautiful way to present your documentation",\n  primary_button_url : "http://devdojo.ticksy.com",\n  primary_button_text : "Support Center",\n  // Look for the icon name here: http://fontawesome.io/icons/\n  primary_button_icon : "fa-book",\n  color_scheme : \'light\',\n  color : \'#F35656\',\n\n  view_documentation_button_text : "",\n\n  video_background : true,\n\n  // Each menu item has an associated URL below. Separate each with commas\n  menu_items 			: 	\'View on Github, Issues, API Ref\',\n  menu_item_urls 		: 	\'http://www.tonylea.com, http://www.facebook.com, http://www.devdojo.com\',\n\n  // Optional social URL\'s (if left blank, they will not be displayed)\n  facebook				:	\'http://www.facebook.com/thedevdojo\',\n  twitter				: 	\'http://www.twitter.com/thedevdojo\',\n  google_plus			: 	\'\',\n  instagram				: 	\'\',\n  pinterest 			: 	\'http://www.pinterest.com/devdojo\',\n  linkedin				: 	\'\',\n  dribbble				: 	\'\',\n  github				: 	\'http://www.github.com/thedevdojo\',\n\n}\n```\n\nSimply change the value of the configuration you wish to make. (Note) leaving the value blank will either hide the element or show a default)\n\nAfter you are done making your changes you\'ll want to save the file and reload your documentation to see the changes.\n\nAdditional Customization\n===\n\nYou may also wish to add your own background image or video based on whichever setting you have chosen.\n\nTo change the background image you can simply replace the file located in:\n\n/magnificent/documentation/background.jpg\n\nor change the video files located in\n\n/magnificent/documentation/video (You may want to replace all the video files to support all browsers)';
